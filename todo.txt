- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff (book?)

- SPC e p should take you to "project", based on .git
- SPC e h for home (~/) and SPC e c for code (~/code)
  and SPC e n instead of SPC f e d

- checkout which-key

- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"
    vim.opt_local.textwidth = 100
    vim.opt_local.spell = true
    vim.opt_local.linebreak = true
    vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    vim.opt_local.concealcursor = "nv"
    vim.opt_local.formatoptions = "tcqjn"
    vim.opt_local.formatlistpat = "^\\s*\\([~]\\+\\|[-]\\+\\)\\s*"

- checkout harpoon I guess

- Copilot

- probably plugin for closing empty buffers that hang around for no reason

- working with htmls tags and such

- context folds at the top

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer

- both the file explorer and terminal really should set cwd when you interact with them
- would be nice if the current file was selected if you go SPC e f to open :Explorer

- prompts in ps (slow), bash (too long) and zsh (no color)

- moving quickly between quickfix list items, like ; and , in addition to ]q and [q

- in norwegian; kind of problematic at times

## known issues

- remove duplicate file paths for SPC s . on windows, and maybe allow closing buffers in SPC s b with
  ctrl+x or something

- cursor flickers when pressing enter in terminals

- <F15> is inserted in insert mode due to caffeine on Windows
