- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"

- checkout harpoon I guess

- working with htmls tags and such

- prompts in ps (slow), bash (too long) and zsh (no color)

- DAP

- rename tabs, sessions ((SPC r l or SPC r t) and SPC r s)

- SESSIONS SESSIONS SESSIONS

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer
  also move up and down the tree structure (next/prev sibling)

- set parinfer's mode to 'paren' when doing a search and replace or replaying a macro
  or renaming a variable with lsp or pasting, to not get into a messed up state
  also maybe go to paren mode when saving to format and then go back to smart?

## known issues

- <C-x><C-e> opens Nano, and probably similar problem if you try to run git in command line
  in bash. combination of nvr and $VISUAL (and detection of running shell in neovim) would
  be needed to solve this.

- linespacing messes up vertical lines like git indicators on files, Telescope borders
  and of course the statusline
  maybe the font itself could be stretched? then we could have the same aesthetic in any
  terminal emulator

- would be nice to see the name of the file when using telescope, whether greping or even searching
  for files, since the path can be quite long in a project.

- find out how to add all the stuff from a Telescope window, for instance live_grep, to the quickfix
  or similar, and then how to navigate through it

- add command to select nightfox/whateverfox theme at will
  also add transparent background when that lands in neovide

- code action and more give an error about windwos flip not working
  opening branch using `b` for instance in neogit

- tabnext and tabprev using cltr+shift+j and k doesn't work in Nvy and terminal (only neovide)

- close tab then move one left custom plugin doesn't really work most of the time

- pressing enter in normal mode in a terminal should put us in insert mode and execute the enter
