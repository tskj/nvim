- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff (book?)

- SPC e p should take you to "project", based on .git
- SPC e h for home (~/) and SPC e c for code (~/code)

- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"
    vim.opt_local.textwidth = 100
    vim.opt_local.spell = true
    vim.opt_local.linebreak = true
    vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    vim.opt_local.concealcursor = "nv"
    vim.opt_local.formatoptions = "tcqjn"
    vim.opt_local.formatlistpat = "^\\s*\\([~]\\+\\|[-]\\+\\)\\s*"

- checkout harpoon I guess

- Copilot

- probably plugin for closing empty buffers that hang around for no reason

- working with htmls tags and such

- context folds at the top

- both the file explorer and terminal really should set cwd when you interact with them
- would be nice if the current file was selected if you go SPC e f to open :Explorer

- prompts in ps (slow), bash (too long) and zsh (no color)

- moving quickly between quickfix list items, like ; and , in addition to ]q and [q

- in norwegian; kind of problematic at times

- DAP

- rename tabs, sessions ((SPC r l or SPC r t) and SPC r s)

- SESSIONS SESSIONS SESSIONS

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer
  also move up and down the tree structure (next/prev sibling)

- set parinfer's mode to 'paren' when doing a search
  and replace or replaying a macro or whatever, to not get into a messed up state
  also maybe go to paren mode when saving to format and then go back to smart?

- faded parens on end of sexps

- add +prefix descriptions to keys on which key!

## known issues

- duplicate file paths for SPC s . on windows sometimes with both backwards and forwards slashes

- <C-x><C-e> opens Nano, and probably similar problem if you try to run git in command line
  in bash. combination of nvr and $VISUAL (and detection of running shell in neovim) would
  be needed to solve this.

- cursor flickers when pressing enter in terminals

- linespacing messes up vertical lines like git indicators on files, Telescope borders
  and of course the statusline
  maybe the font itself could be stretched? then we could have the same aesthetic in any
  terminal emulator

- pressing D in visual mode (regular, not block) doesn't yank the text to the register like it should
  (or rather it _does_, however it takes the whole line?)

- would be nice to see the name of the file when using telescope, whether greping or even searching
  for files, since the path can be quite long in a project. (also how do I scroll in the preview?)

- find out how to add all the stuff from a Telescope window, for instance live_grep, to the quickfix
  or similar, and then how to navigate through it

- add command to select nightfox/whateverfox theme at will
  also add transparent background when that lands in neovide

- neogit no longer opens commit message window to the side (but instead opens it above :()
  also there's annoying warnings if you don't capitalize first word

- okay so shift+D should _not_ in fact yank to the register in visual selection mode
  instead use VX to cut selections (and/or lines)
