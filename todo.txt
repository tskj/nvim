- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff

- add a leader shortcut (SPC q r) to reload neovim (preferrably with all panes and such open)

- find out how to get back my buffer if I accidentally open :Ex

- find out how to ignore <F15>

- figure out which terminal to use, and then how to open them

- add a leader shortcut to run :PackerInstall
  also I guess, add a shortcut to run make and then :PackerInstall, and then maybe reload?
  or maybe just separate commands?

- find out if it's possibly to lock packer plugin versions
  also find out how packer works I guess?
  packer is deprecated, I guess find an alternative :sob:

- rename (SPC s e)

- using the nix trick of changing the upstream code, I'd like to set
  {:MiniStarterFooter {:style "not-italic!"}}
  and also maybe MiniStarterSection to a less obtrusive color
  see this PR: https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim/pull/174

- opening terminal from file explorer should land you in the cwd of the file explorer

- fzf-lua vs telescope? hmm
