- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff

- add a leader shortcut to run :PackerInstall
  also I guess, add a shortcut to run make and then :PackerInstall, and then maybe reload?
  or maybe just separate commands?

- add a leader shortcut (SPC q r) to reload neovim (preferrably with all panes and such open)

- find out how to get back my buffer if I accidentally open :Ex

- find out how to ignore <F15>

- figure out which terminal I want to use, and then how to open them

- set cwd automatically when switching buffers or w/e

- set tabs correctly (for html and js and stuff, it already works for fennel)

- find out how to save a scratch buffer?

- fix syntax highlighting on fennel

- find out if it's possibly to lock packer plugin versions
  also find out how packer works I guess?

- is there like an inverse of `:only` (SPC w o) ?

- relieve <C-e> of being window resize, since I have a leader key for it
