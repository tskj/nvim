- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff (book?)

- SPC e p should take you to "project", based on .git
- SPC e h for home (~/) and SPC e c for code (~/code)

- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"
    vim.opt_local.textwidth = 100
    vim.opt_local.spell = true
    vim.opt_local.linebreak = true
    vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    vim.opt_local.concealcursor = "nv"
    vim.opt_local.formatoptions = "tcqjn"
    vim.opt_local.formatlistpat = "^\\s*\\([~]\\+\\|[-]\\+\\)\\s*"

- checkout harpoon I guess

- Copilot

- probably plugin for closing empty buffers that hang around for no reason

- working with htmls tags and such

- context folds at the top

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer

- both the file explorer and terminal really should set cwd when you interact with them
- would be nice if the current file was selected if you go SPC e f to open :Explorer

- prompts in ps (slow), bash (too long) and zsh (no color)

- moving quickly between quickfix list items, like ; and , in addition to ]q and [q

- in norwegian; kind of problematic at times

- DAP

- rename tabs, sessions ((SPC r l or SPC r t) and SPC r s)

- SESSIONS SESSIONS SESSIONS

- indent correctly on blank lines in parinfer buffers
  so if we're not on first line and our line is blank:
    check if the line above is non-blank:
      if we're to the left of the start of text on line above, indent more
      so that we're on the same column

## known issues

- duplicate file paths for SPC s . on windows sometimes with both backwards and forwards slashes

- <C-x><C-e> opens Nano, and probably similar problem if you try to run git in command line
  in bash. combination of nvr and $VISUAL (and detection of running shell in neovim) would
  be needed to solve this.

- cursor flickers when pressing enter in terminals

- <F15> is inserted in insert mode due to caffeine on Windows

- linespacing messes up vertical lines like git indicators on files, Telescope borders
  and of course the statusline
  maybe the font itself could be stretched? then we could have the same aesthetic in any
  terminal emulator
