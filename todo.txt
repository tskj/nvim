- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"
    vim.opt_local.textwidth = 100
    vim.opt_local.spell = true
    vim.opt_local.linebreak = true
    vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    vim.opt_local.concealcursor = "nv"
    vim.opt_local.formatoptions = "tcqjn"
    vim.opt_local.formatlistpat = "^\\s*\\([~]\\+\\|[-]\\+\\)\\s*"

- checkout harpoon I guess

- working with htmls tags and such

- prompts in ps (slow), bash (too long) and zsh (no color)

- DAP

- rename tabs, sessions ((SPC r l or SPC r t) and SPC r s)

- SESSIONS SESSIONS SESSIONS

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer
  also move up and down the tree structure (next/prev sibling)

- set parinfer's mode to 'paren' when doing a search and replace or replaying a macro
  or renaming a variable with lsp or pasting, to not get into a messed up state
  also maybe go to paren mode when saving to format and then go back to smart?
  mini.pair changes parens in a well formed manner

## known issues

- <C-x><C-e> opens Nano, and probably similar problem if you try to run git in command line
  in bash. combination of nvr and $VISUAL (and detection of running shell in neovim) would
  be needed to solve this.

- linespacing messes up vertical lines like git indicators on files, Telescope borders
  and of course the statusline
  maybe the font itself could be stretched? then we could have the same aesthetic in any
  terminal emulator

- would be nice to see the name of the file when using telescope, whether greping or even searching
  for files, since the path can be quite long in a project.

- find out how to add all the stuff from a Telescope window, for instance live_grep, to the quickfix
  or similar, and then how to navigate through it

- add command to select nightfox/whateverfox theme at will
  also add transparent background when that lands in neovide

- code action and more give an error about windwos flip not working
  opening branch using `b` for instance in neogit

- tabnext and tabprev using cltr+shift+j and k doesn't work in Nvy and terminal (only neovide)

- close tab then move one left custom plugin doesn't really work most of the time

- pressing enter in normal mode in a terminal should put us in insert mode and execute the enter

- see filepath in small float window:
function ShowFilePathFloat()
    -- Get the current file path
    local file_path = vim.fn.expand('%:p')

    -- Create a small floating window
    local buf = vim.api.nvim_create_buf(false, true)
    local width = math.min(80, vim.fn.strwidth(file_path) + 2)
    local height = 1
    local opts = {
        relative = 'editor',
        width = width,
        height = height,
        row = math.floor((vim.o.lines - height) / 2),
        col = math.floor((vim.o.columns - width) / 2),
        style = 'minimal',
        border = 'rounded',
    }

    -- Set the content of the floating window to the file path
    vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf, 0, -1, false, { file_path })

    -- Open the floating window with the specified options
    vim.api.nvim_open_win(buf, true, opts)

    -- Allow normal mode operations (like visual selection) inside the float
    vim.cmd('normal! gg0')
end

-- Map it to a keybinding
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', '<leader>p', ':lua ShowFilePathFloat()<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })

- maybe show the full file path when browsing in telescope in the messsage thinghy where the command line is

- lsp signature info when typing in insert mode: https://chatgpt.com/c/671422de-1330-800b-9639-fb113d72f024

- SPC s v -> search visual, namely use telescope to fuzzy search in current buffer
  SPC s e -> search SEssions, whenver we get that working

- when oil window receives focus it needs to also set cwd

- SPC c a or SPC c a p for clipboard append maybe? so I can append stuff to the system clipboard
  incrementally, something I often want!

- contextfold at the top should be off by default and toggleable by a keybinding

- should have a completion thing for identifiers or text in the buffer, presumably much faster than the lsp
  there is telescope-completion for searching, maybe eventually add my fuzzy searcher thing there

- en keybinding som ligner p√• o som flytter cursoren _rett_ ned, i motsetning til vanlig o som i clojure
  code sender til et litt random sted (som du som oftest vil, men noen ganger vil man straight down)
  SPC o kanskje?

- you want to indent stuff not just as leading padding! it's also convenient to format stuff by indenting
  further to the right so that stuff on lines above and below line up nicely (like jon blow likes to do).
  this can be automated by knowing the tabwidth thingy (tabstop?) and searching for "secondary" tabs,
  those further to the right of the main padding (this also therefore requries tabs to not be auto spaced).
  we can then calculate how many to add or remove on all adjacent lines (where adjacent is calculating
  based on empty lines) to make all the secondary tabstops align. can be bound to a keybinding to act where
  the cursor is.

- conjure ,er open window to the side instead of over?

- search todos and search diagnostics should respect git project, not just cwd
