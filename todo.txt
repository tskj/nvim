- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff

- find out how to ignore <F15>

- figure out which terminal to use, and then how to open them

- find out if it's possibly to lock packer plugin versions
  also find out how packer works I guess?
  packer is deprecated, I guess find an alternative :sob:

- opening terminal from file explorer should land you in the cwd of the file explorer

- fzf-lua vs telescope? hmm

- code_actions need to work with something other than F4 (like ctlr+.)
  fine if it's fzf-lua that does it or w/e

- need to be able to open terminal from :Explorer and have it land in correct directory

- would be nice if the current file was selected if you go SPC e f to open :Explorer

- SPC e p should take you to "project", whatever that is--need to figure out the project
  thing for sessions anyway

- SPC e h for home (~/) and SPC e c for code (~/code)

- want everything to be installed through scoop somehow, including git or whatever
