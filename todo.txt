- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff (book?)

- find out how to ignore <F15>

- opening terminal from file explorer should land you in the cwd of the file explorer

- make sure telescope is responsible for code_actions as well (ctrl+enter)

- would be nice if the current file was selected if you go SPC e f to open :Explorer

- SPC e p should take you to "project", whatever that is--need to figure out the project
  thing for sessions anyway

- SPC e h for home (~/) and SPC e c for code (~/code)
  and SPC e n instead of SPC f e d

- checkout which-key

- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"
    vim.opt_local.textwidth = 100
    vim.opt_local.spell = true
    vim.opt_local.linebreak = true
    vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    vim.opt_local.concealcursor = "nv"
    vim.opt_local.formatoptions = "tcqjn"
    vim.opt_local.formatlistpat = "^\\s*\\([~]\\+\\|[-]\\+\\)\\s*"

- probably plugin for closing empty buffers that hang around for no reason

- working with htmls tags and such

- context folds at the top

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer

- both the file explorer and terminal really should set cwd when you interact with them

- powershell prompt seems to be very slow when it's in a git repository

- why doesn't ctrl+l clear the screen in terminal emulator, neither in wsl nor windows?

- ctrl+p is broken in zsh, but also the prompt is weird (both color and the cursor flickers when newline)
  probably re-install zsh in wsl

- SPC s g seemed to be broken in wsl, maybe I've not installed rg?
