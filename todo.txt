- write a readme that explains how it works and what to do run stuff

- find out how to ignore <F15>

- figure out which terminal to use, and then how to open them

- find out if it's possibly to lock packer plugin versions
  also find out how packer works I guess?
  packer is deprecated, I guess find an alternative :sob:

- opening terminal from file explorer should land you in the cwd of the file explorer

- fzf-lua vs telescope? hmm
  needs to be responsible for code_actions as well (ctrl+enter)

- need to be able to open terminal from :Explorer and have it land in correct directory

- would be nice if the current file was selected if you go SPC e f to open :Explorer

- SPC e p should take you to "project", whatever that is--need to figure out the project
  thing for sessions anyway

- SPC e h for home (~/) and SPC e c for code (~/code)

- want everything to be installed through scoop somehow, including git or whatever

- terminal should probably start in insert mode

- kickstart: highlighting stuff you're doing--TextYankPost autocmd!

- folke/todo-comments.nvim

- checkout which-key

- checkout neorg, also nvim-orgmode/orgmode
  settings for norg files:
    vim.opt_local.colorcolumn = "100"
    vim.opt_local.textwidth = 100
    vim.opt_local.spell = true
    vim.opt_local.linebreak = true
    vim.opt_local.spelllang = "en"
    vim.opt_local.concealcursor = "nv"
    vim.opt_local.formatoptions = "tcqjn"
    vim.opt_local.formatlistpat = "^\\s*\\([~]\\+\\|[-]\\+\\)\\s*"

- probably plugin for closing empty buffers that hang around for no reason

- working with htmls tags and such

- context folds at the top

- see if some form of sexp keybindings like slurp can work together with parinfer

- maybe I can make my own multicursor / multiselection thing? they all seem too complicated
  actually maybe this one is good: mg979/vim-visual-multi even though it's vimscript
